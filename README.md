## How To Use / Questions

### Selecting Flights
Open the Flight TrackAR app and tap any airplane to view information and see the 3D ground view of it (may take a second to load). You can also search for specific airlines and flight numbers in the search bar!

### Rotating/Scaling the Globe
Using a pinching motion with two fingers you can scale the globe to make it bigger or smaller to help find flights. To rotate the globe, use two fingers and drag them in a circular motion as if you were screwing in a screw.

### How do I go back to the globe after selecting a flight?
Swipe to the right of the screen to return to the globe.

### Why does it sometimes crash when selecting a flight?
Blame the [MapBox iOS SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-scenekit) for having poor thread and memory management
